Milestones 1 and 2 were straight forward. Good practice to play around and experiment.

Milestone 3 proved to be rather difficult. Perhaps it was just difficult for me as I had many errors. Some of which where I had to reprogram numerous functions in previous modules.

Milestone 3 is a good eye opener for me as there is still lots of ways for me to go.
